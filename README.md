# UNT_SPring2022_DeepLearning_Project

As mentioned in the project requirements the code must contain:

1) **Loading the dataset and transforming the dataset**
This is doen in each and every .ipynb file before training the model. 

2)**Defining the base line model and our model**
We are not using any base line model and we couldn't find one because our model is kinda 
new implementation, with the approach. 

3) **Running a training loop on a training set with both models**
 As we mentioned, we do not have any base model and we are working on our own model 
 so we have runned the training loop on tarining data
 
4)**Evaluating the models with test dataset**
We have eveluated our model with test dataset in thge Merging_models.ipynb file where 
we also displayed the results of the predictions with diplaying the images in the last of the notebook. 

5)**Displaying the resulkts on test dataset**
We have eveluated our model with test dataset in thge Merging_models.ipynb file where 
we also displayed the results of the predictions with diplaying the images in the last of the notebook.
